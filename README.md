# Student Performance Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook focused on analyzing a student performance dataset as a part of mathsmatics of data science course. The notebook encompasses the following key steps:

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Visualization of data.
   - Handling missing or illogical variables.
   - Outlier detection and removal.

2. **Data Description Report:**
   - Summary report providing insights into dataset statistics, distributions, and trends.

3. **Correlation Matrix:**
   - Calculation of the correlation matrix between math, reading, and writing scores.
   - Visualization using a heatmap.

4. **Naive Bayes Prediction:**
   - Application of a Naive Bayes algorithm to predict test preparation course outcomes.

5. **Accuracy Report:**
   - Generation of a concise table summarizing accuracy scores for model evaluation.
